# Zero-shot Classification Boost with Self-training

This is a class project for natural language processing CS533. We forked this repository to implement the self-training method presented in this [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.73). 

In order to run the cases, we can use the `RunningCase.ipynb` notebook.
